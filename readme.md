# Awesome React Framer X [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This is an awesome list with links to courses, tutorials & videos to learn everything about [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [ES6](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/).

## What's Framer X

[Framer X](https://framer.com/x) is a powerful Interaction Design tool. A Beta Program started on August 1st to try and give feedback to the team. Please read the **[Official Documentation](https://framer.gitbook.io/framer/)**.

Beta I comes with a new Design Store of reusable UI components (powered by NPM). On the store you will find a collection of interactive design & code components such as maps, random image generators, video and audio players, Design System Kits (iOS & Android) and more.

React components for Framer X Beta 1 **will only support `TypeScript`**. `ES6` support is expected for the final release.

If you want to get started with React:

- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - Make sure to check out the new React Docs. It's an overview of the most useful resources including the [Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorial.
- [React for Designers](http://reactfordesigners.com/), made by [@zach\_\_johnston](https://twitter.com/zach__johnston), a quick guide to help you avoid the option paralysis.
